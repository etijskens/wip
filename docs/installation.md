# Installation

## Installing on a workstation

`Wiptools` is published on [PyPI](https://pypi.org/), and hence it can be installed with its 
dependencies as:

```shell
> pip install wiptools
```

This installs the bare `wip`. Because `wip` relies on quite a bit of other tools, installing al its
dependencies may waste quite a bit of resources, especially on clusters.
